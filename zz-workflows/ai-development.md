```

## AI-Assisted Development Patterns

### 1. Test-Driven Development with AI
```bash
# Start with AI-generated test cases
# Prompt: "Generate comprehensive test cases for user authentication"

# Example AI-generated tests
describe('User Authentication', () => {
  it('should authenticate valid user credentials', async () => {
    // AI-generated test implementation
  })
  
  it('should reject invalid credentials', async () => {
    // AI-generated test implementation
  })
  
  it('should handle network errors gracefully', async () => {
    // AI-generated test implementation
  })
})

# Then implement features to pass tests
```

### 2. Code Review and Refactoring
```bash
# Use AI for code review
# Prompt: "Review this function for performance, security, and maintainability"

# AI-assisted refactoring
# Prompt: "Refactor this code to use modern ES6+ features and improve readability"

# Example before/after with AI suggestions
// Before (AI identifies issues)
function processUsers(users) {
  var result = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    if (users[i].active == true) {
      result.push(users[i].name);
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// After (AI-suggested improvements)
const processUsers = (users) => 
  users
    .filter(user => user.active)
    .map(user => user.name);
```

### 3. Documentation Generation
```bash
# AI-generated API documentation
# Prompt: "Generate comprehensive API documentation for these endpoints"

# AI-generated README sections
# Prompt: "Create a getting started guide for this project"

# AI-generated code comments
# Prompt: "Add JSDoc comments to explain this complex algorithm"
```

## Workflow Integration Patterns

# AI provides:
# - Service boundaries
# - Communication patterns
# - Data flow diagrams
# - Technology recommendations
```

### 2. Database Design and Optimization
```bash
# AI-assisted database design
# Prompt: "Design a PostgreSQL schema for a social media application"

# AI provides:
# - Table structures
# - Relationships and constraints
# - Indexing strategies
# - Query optimization
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
```bash
# AI-assisted performance analysis
# Prompt: "Analyze this React component for performance issues and suggest optimizations"

# AI identifies:
# - Unnecessary re-renders
# - Memory leaks
# - Bundle size optimizations
# - Caching opportunities
```

### 4. Security Analysis
```bash
# AI security review
# Prompt: "Perform a security audit of this authentication system"

# AI checks for:
# - Input validation
# - SQL injection vulnerabilities
# - XSS prevention
# - Authentication flaws
```

## Context Management Strategies

### Project Knowledge Base
```bash
# Maintain comprehensive project context
├── CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md      # Main project context
├── ARCHITECTURE.md        # System architecture
├── API_DOCS.md           # API documentation
├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md    # Common issues and solutions
└── CHANGELOG.md          # Recent changes and decisions
```

### Context Updating Workflow
```bash
# Regular context updates
# After major changes, update context files
echo "## Recent Changes ($(date))" >> CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
echo "- Implemented user authentication" >> CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
echo "- Added rate limiting middleware" >> CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
echo "- Updated database schema" >> CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
```

### Multi-Repository Context
```bash
# For microservices or multi-repo projects
# Create shared context repository
mkdir -p ~/code/shared-context
cat > ~/code/shared-context/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md << 'EOF'
# System-Wide Context

## Service Architecture
- Auth Service: Handles authentication and authorization
- User Service: Manages user profiles and preferences
- Payment Service: Processes payments and billing

## Shared Patterns
- Error handling conventions
- Logging standards
- API versioning strategy

```

## AI Prompt Engineering for Development

### Effective Prompt Patterns

#### Code Generation
```bash
# Specific and contextual prompts
"Create a React hook for managing form state with validation, 
using TypeScript, and following our project's error handling patterns"

# Instead of generic prompts
"Create a form hook"
```

#### Code Review
```bash
# Comprehensive review prompts
"Review this authentication function for:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance issues
3. Code maintainability
4. TypeScript best practices
5. Our project's coding standards"
```

#### Debugging
```bash
# Detailed debugging prompts
"This function is throwing a TypeError. Here's the error stack trace: [trace]
Here's the function: [code]
Here's how it's being called: [usage]
What's causing the error and how can I fix it?"
```

### Prompt Templates

#### Feature Implementation
```bash
# Template for feature requests
cat > ~/.claude/templates/feature-implementation.md << 'EOF'
# Feature Implementation Request

## Context

## Continuous Learning Integration

### AI-Assisted Learning
```bash
# Learn new technologies with AI guidance
# Prompt: "I'm learning GraphQL. Create a progressive learning plan with practical examples"

# AI provides:
# - Structured learning path
# - Hands-on exercises
# - Real-world examples
# - Best practices
```

### Knowledge Gaps Identification
```bash
# AI identifies learning opportunities
# Prompt: "Analyze my codebase and identify areas where I could improve my skills"

# AI suggests:
# - Advanced patterns to learn
# - Modern alternatives to current approaches
# - Performance optimization techniques
# - Security best practices
```

## Troubleshooting AI Development Issues

### Context Overload
```bash
# When context becomes too large
# Break down into focused sessions
claude-session.sh --task "Focus on authentication module only"

# Use specific context files
cp AUTH_CONTEXT.md CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
```

### Inconsistent Responses
```bash
# Maintain conversation continuity
# Keep session notes
echo "Previous AI suggestions implemented:" >> SESSION_NOTES.md
echo "- Added JWT middleware" >> SESSION_NOTES.md
echo "- Implemented rate limiting" >> SESSION_NOTES.md
```

### Integration Challenges
```bash
# When AI suggestions don't fit existing codebase
# Provide more context about existing patterns
# Include relevant code snippets
# Specify constraints and requirements clearly
```

## Measuring AI Development Impact

### Productivity Metrics
```bash
# Track development velocity
# Before AI: Time to implement features
# After AI: Reduced implementation time
# Code quality improvements
# Bug reduction rates
```

### Quality Improvements
```bash
# Code review metrics
# Reduced review iterations
# Fewer bugs in production
# Better test coverage
# Improved documentation quality
```

### Learning Acceleration
```bash
# Knowledge acquisition speed
# Time to learn new technologies
# Implementation of best practices
# Architecture decision quality
```
